# Xcode light theme for VS Code.

Theme inspired by Xcode's Default light theme.

## Instructions

Clone the repository and move the folder to `~/.vscode/extensions`.

## Acknowledgements:

This theme is based on _Default Light theme for Xcode_ by [Apple](https://apple.com).

I created this theme to match Xcode's Objective-c, C++, and C (I haven't tested on Swift) light default theme text colors in VS Code, I plan to keep improving it over time, but if you encounter an inconsistency feel free to contribute!
