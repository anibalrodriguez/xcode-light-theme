# Xcode light theme for VS Code.

Theme inspired by Xcode's Default light theme.

## Instructions

Clone the repository and move the folder to `~/.vscode/extensions`.

## Acknowledgements:

This theme is based on _Default Light theme for Xcode_ by [Apple](https://apple.com).

I created this theme to match Xcode's Objective-c, C++, and C text highlights, which is not perfect, yet.
